Peculiarities:
The assignment is testing our familiarity on lisp: how well we can use a
functional (lambda calculus based) language. 

Another essential point of this assignment is recursion. Recursion is an idea
that breaks a big problem into several base cases. Thus, this assignment is 
also a practice of how to break functions like "match", "match-var" into easier
situations --- from direct match to wildcard (? and !), from wildcard to direct
match and also from wildcard to wildcard. It is important for us to know when
we need to change from one to the other.

Since lisp is a new language to us, we search a lot of basic information from
website. We get the basic overview from "yiibai.com", and get some specific
function info from "clhs.lisp.se".

Work:
The last test fail.
